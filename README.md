# teensy_audio_library_scrubber
A smooth, live scrubber object for use within the teensy audio library.
In order to work, this object needs a pointer to sizeable audio array stored in ram (i use DMAMEM/RAM2 and it works great), take a look
at the example to see it in action. 

This object enables smooth scrubbing and variable speed playback of raw audio files stored on an SD card.

Feel free to throw into your projects, if you use it please tell me!
