# teensy_audio_library_scrubber
A smooth, live scrubber object for use within the teensy audio library.
Give this object a pointer to an array of 16 bit int audio samples, choose a target position from 0 to 1, and set a scrubbing rate, and the object will smoothly scrub through that audio array. It sounds a lot like scratching a vinyl record, or scrubbing through some tape.
